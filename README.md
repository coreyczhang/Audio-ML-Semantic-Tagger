# CNN-Based Audio Semantic Tagger

A deep learning system for extracting semantic representations from audio signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This research project explores automated music information retrieval (MIR) through learned audio embeddings.

## Overview

This project implements a CNN-based approach to generate semantic vectors from audio files, enabling tasks like music similarity analysis, automatic tagging, and audio content understanding. The system processes raw audio waveforms through mel-spectrogram conversion and deep feature extraction to create meaningful representations of audio content.

## Research Context

Developed as part of music information retrieval research focusing on:
- **Semantic audio understanding**: Extracting high-level features that capture musical meaning
- **Transfer learning applications**: Leveraging pre-trained vision architectures (ResNet18) for audio tasks
- **Audio embedding generation**: Creating compact vector representations for downstream tasks
